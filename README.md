# Form-proper-data-from-MidasFEA-Output-file

The script is written in Visual Basic for Excel file. It allows the user to browse the dynamics data of the MidasFEA output file, which should be processed by removing all text in the middle of the file. The data is then automatically rearranged in a consistent order (time by row and sensor location by column) in a new worksheet and exported to a text file for further process in MATLAB.
